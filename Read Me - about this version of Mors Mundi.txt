This is an incomplete version of the game called Mors Mundi ("Death of the world"). 
The goal is to destroy the other players: one can kill the whole population, destroy the planet or throw the game by destroying the whole solar system. All effects should include visible animations (e.g. creating a black hole and throwing a player into it).
Players accumulate various resources (e.g. gold, exomatter, energy level) over time. They do that by collecting and playing cards at the right time. 
Each player has a planet and moves in a circle around the Sun by stepping on various coloured fields. On each field, something happens and the population increases or decreases automatically based on the population growth rate. 
There are different cards in the game. Players start by choosing Level 1 Cards first, which add the basic resources and symbolise the most primitive technologies (fire, wheel etc.). Level 2 Cards are based on our present state of society and include technologies like satellites and missiles. Level 3 Cards are meant to deal fatal blows and e.g. throw a player into the black hole, wormhole or the Sun.
Another type of cards are "Bargain cards" - these cards are created randomly based on pieces of texts and various parameters. Players can accept a bargain and will lose something in order to gain something.

This is the initial version of the game. Not all functionalities have been implemented. There are various bugs.
It includes various free to use sources like the Universe skybox visible in the background as well as fonts.
The pictures visible on cards are just placeholders found online and meant only for the first version of the game.
